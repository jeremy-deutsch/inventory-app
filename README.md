# Inventory App

Bootstrapped using the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-cli)'s GraphQL/React boilerplate. To start, run the backend server by running `yarn && yarn start` from inside the `server` directory. Then, run the frontend server by running `yarn && yarn start` from inside the main directory. You should be able to see the app at `localhost:3000`!
